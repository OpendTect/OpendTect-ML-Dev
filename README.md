## Getting started

To get started with Machine Learning in OpendTect several datasets are provided on TerraNubis with which all plugins are available for all users.
There is [F3 offshore the Netherlands](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/F3-Demo-2023), [Penobscot](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/Penobscot), [FORCE ML Competition 2020](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/FORCE-ML-Competition-2020), [FORCE ML Competition 2020 Synthethic Models and Wells](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/FORCE-ML-Competition-2020-Synthetic-Models-and-Wells) and the recently added [Delft](https://terranubis.com/datainfo/Delft). These can all be found on [TerraNubis](https://terranubis.com/)

Follow the steps below to install OpendTect 7.0 and download the complete datasets.

- Step 1: Download the [installer for OpendTect 7.0](https://dgbes.com/download)
